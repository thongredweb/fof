NOTES FOR TINKERS
============================================================================
Last update: May 18th, 2014 w/ Bootstrap 2.3.2

When importing a new Bootstrap release you have to:
• Build all LESS files in the strapper/akeeba_strapper/less directory
• Copy and rename the generated CSS files in the strapper/akeeba_strapper/css directory. Hint: look at the headers.
• Update the strapper/akeeba_strapper/img directory with the new Bootstrap assets
• Update the strapper/akeeba_strapper/js directory with the new Bootstrap bootstrap.min.js file

IMPORTANT! To ensure compatibility with Joomla! 3 we cannot upgrade to Bootstrap 3 or later
